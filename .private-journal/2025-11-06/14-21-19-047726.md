## Project Notes

claudecode-macmenu menubar icon issue: The Tray icon wasn't visible because `assets/icon-template.png` was missing. The code has a fallback to `nativeImage.createEmpty()` which creates an invisible icon. Created simple circle icons using ImageMagick. macOS template icons need to be black with transparency to auto-adapt to light/dark mode. Location: src/main.ts:115-134
