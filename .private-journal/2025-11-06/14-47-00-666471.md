## Project Notes

claudecode-macmenu: Implemented comprehensive settings/preferences window with:
- 4 tabbed interface (General, Notifications, Menu Display, Advanced)
- PreferencesWindow class using singleton pattern with IPC handlers (src/windows/preferences.ts)
- Extended Settings interface with menuVisibility object for per-stat toggles + compactMode flag
- All 14 macOS system sounds (glass, hero, blow, bottle, frog, funk, ping, pop, purr, submarine, basso, morse, sosumi, tink)
- Conditional menu rendering in main.ts based on visibility settings
- Native macOS styling with vibrancy, dark mode support via CSS media queries
- Renderer process script (plain JS) handling UI interactions and IPC
- Build system updated to copy UI files (HTML/CSS/JS) to dist folder

Key files:
- src/windows/preferences.ts (new)
- src/ui/preferences.html (new)
- src/ui/preferences.css (new)
- src/ui/renderer/preferences.js (new, plain JS not TS to avoid DOM type issues)
- src/services/settings.ts (extended Settings interface)
- src/services/notification.ts (added 14 sounds)
- src/main.ts (added PreferencesWindow integration, menu → ⌘, conditional rendering)
- package.json (updated build script to copy UI files)
- tsconfig.json (excluded renderer folder from TS compilation)

Architecture: Main process handles all business logic, renderer just does UI + IPC. Settings auto-save on change. Menu rebuilds when settings change via callback.
